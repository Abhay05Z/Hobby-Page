      <p>
        <!-- Block element -->
        Reading has been my hobby not from a very long time but only after my
        12th board examinations. Because from then on I was feeling lonely and
        missing the exam days when I have to complete my course books in a week
        or sometimes in few days only.

        Rubix cube is my hooby froma a very young age. My father gifted me a
        rubix cube and from then only my aim was to learn how to solve it. After
        vigrous hardwork on solving and watching many tutorials on how to solve
        it, under a week I mastered the skill of solving a rubix cube.

      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <!-- Block element -->
      <p>
        I am into photography the day I got a pet. I learnt how to click good
        pictures with your mobile only using the pro mode that is already given
        in camera. I watched hundreds of videos learning the concept of
        photography and mastered the pro mode.
